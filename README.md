# NESARC Report
U.S. National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions 
by Cory Tracy

## Preface
After reviewing various datasets, I decided to focus on the NESARC report for my analysis. This dataset seemed the most interesting and comprehensive, and it would allow me to delve deeply into my area of interest: regional data related to major depression. As I began working with the data, I found myself particularly interested in exploring this topic further.

## Research Question
Which region has the highest prevalence of major depression?

## Hypothesis
After reviewing the codebook, I have identified enough relevant data to pursue my hypothesis that states with less sunshine may have higher rates of depression. To confirm the accuracy of this hypothesis, further research and analysis will be necessary. My ultimate aim in this research is to reach conclusions that are backed by the data and that shed light on the relationship between sunshine and depression rates in different states.

## Codebook
I have chosen to use seven variables for my dataset: IDNUM, SEX, AGE, REGION, S4AQ1, S4AQ2, and S4AQ53. I believe this is the best approach given the information I have. However, I am starting to realize that the data is largely qualitative and may not provide any useful insights into my hypothesis. I may consider adding additional variables as I progress through the project in order to extract useful data.

## Literature Review
I conducted a search on Google Scholar for studies on depression by state and found several relevant studies. However, I noticed that many of these studies do not place a strong emphasis on regional data. The CDC has data on current depression rates by state, which range from 4.8% in North Dakota to 14.8% in Mississippi [1]. One study used Google Trends data to map population depression and found evidence of seasonal patterns [2]. Another factor that I had not considered is that it may not be a lack of sunshine specifically, but rather a deficiency in Vitamin D, that contributes to depression [3]. As we delve deeper into the data, we will be better able to begin answering questions about these potential relationships.
